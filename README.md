# CSharp_Algorithms

Algorithm implementations using C# programming language. I am currently reviewing algorithms on my free time and figured I could
use them as exercises and practice. I will add algorithm implementations when I can. 


## Sorting Algorithms
Algorithms that are used to rearrange a given array or list elements according to an order. The most frequently used orders are numerical order and lexicographical order, either ascending or descending. The output of any sorting algorithm must satisfy two conditions:
- Output must be in monotonic order
- Output is a permutation of the input

/***************************************
Merge Sort:

An efficient, general-purpose, and comparison-based sorting
algorithm. Merge sort is a divide and conquer algorithm. It 
divides the input array into halves until it has n sublists,
then it repeatedly merges these sublists untill there is only
one sublist remaining. This final sublist is the sorted list.
